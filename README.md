# Movie-Dataset-Exploratory-Data-Analysis
This exploratory data analysis examines trends in movie performance using a dataset of over 5,000 films.
The analysis focuses on four key areas:

Audience engagement (ratings, votes, reviews), Financial performance (budget vs. gross revenue), Genre patterns and distributions
, Feature relationships and correlations. The goal is to understand the factors that most strongly contribute to a movie’s commercial and audience success.
